Here's the enhanced version with added installation instructions:

# Technical Implementation Report

## Overview
Implementation of a real-time video streaming application using GStreamer, Python, and Flask. The system captures video from webcam and streams it through a client-server architecture.

## Architecture
- Frontend: PyQt5-based GUI client
- Backend: Flask REST API
- Streaming: GStreamer pipeline
- Resolution: 1280x720 at 30fps

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- GStreamer 1.0

### System Dependencies
For macOS:
```bash
brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly gst-libav
```

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
```

### Python Environment Setup
1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verifying Installation
To verify the installation:
```bash
python -c "import cv2; import PyQt5; import flask; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"
```

## Key Features
1. Real-time webcam streaming
2. REST API control endpoints
3. Dark-themed modern UI
4. Status indicators
5. Error handling

## Performance
- Low latency video transmission
- Smooth frame rate at 30fps
- Efficient memory usage

## Technical Highlights
- GStreamer pipeline optimization
- Thread management for UI responsiveness
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Clean shutdown handling

## Future Enhancements
1. MQTT integration
2. Video compression options
3. YOLO object detection
4. Recording capability

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation:
1. Ensure your Python version is compatible (check with `python --version`)
2. Verify GStreamer installation (check with `gst-launch-1.0 --version`)
3. For dependency conflicts, try installing packages one by one from requirements.txt
